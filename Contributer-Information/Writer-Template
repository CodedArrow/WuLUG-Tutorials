Notes and Introduction
  In this section, write any things that would cause the writeup to not be applicable to the reader, any limitations, or other dependencies. You could also include how to setup the software, if necessary.
  Also, introduce yourself (if you'd like) and the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tutorial
  Try to keep your writup specific to one thing. Many programs have a scope much greater than a single use case, so don't feel the need to include it all. it could overwhelm the reader.
  Additionally, its easier to navigate the tutorials if this is done. 
  An example could be with Wireshark- feel free to make different tutorials for basics, more in-depth filtering and analysis, and for different use cases.
